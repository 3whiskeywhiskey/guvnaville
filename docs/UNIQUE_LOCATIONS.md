## Location Interactions & Synergies

### Power Grid Networks
Connecting power sources to cities via power grid infrastructure:
- Solar Farm + Power Grid → City Hall = Powered government
- Nuclear Plant + Power Grid → Factory = Maximum production

### Supply Chains
Locations work better together:
- University + Library + High School = Research complex (+50% bonus)
- Hospital + Pharmaceutical Lab + Medical School = Medical hub (+50% bonus)
- Factory + Scrapyard + Workshop = Industrial complex (+50% bonus)

### Cultural Districts
Grouping cultural buildings:
- Museum + Theater + Broadcast Station = Cultural District (+3 culture/turn bonus)
- City Hall + Library + Monument = Government Quarter (+2 diplomatic power)

### Defensive Positions
Strategic military placement:
- Bridge + Watchtower + Fortification = Chokepoint (nearly impregnable)
- High Ground + Sniper Tower + Barricades = Kill zone

---

## Location Capture Mechanics

### Capturing Neutral Locations
1. Move unit onto tile
2. Spend 1 turn "securing" location (clear hazards, claim)
3. Location becomes yours

### Capturing Enemy Locations
1. Defeat defending forces
2. Occupy location for 3 turns (enemy can counter-attack)
3. After 3 turns, location converts

### Siege Mechanics
Surround location with 4+ adjacent units:
- Besieged location suffers attrition
- Can't produce resources while besieged
- Defenders can sally out to break siege
- After 5 turns, location surrenders (if not relieved)

### Location Damage
Combat near locations can damage them:
- Light damage: -50% production (can repair)
- Heavy damage: -75% production (expensive repair)
- Destroyed: Location permanently lost (some can't be rebuilt)

**Fallout-Style Dark Humor**: Destroying the only hospital grants achievement "What Could Go Wrong?"
