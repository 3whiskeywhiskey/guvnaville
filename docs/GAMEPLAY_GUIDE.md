# Gameplay Guide: From Ashes to Empire

## Welcome to the Ruins

You've survived the collapse. Hundreds haven't. Now you lead a small group of survivors in a ruined city where every building, every resource, and every choice could mean the difference between extinction and empire.

This guide will teach you how to play **Ashes to Empire** and build your post-apocalyptic civilization.

## Tutorial Campaign: First Steps

### Turn 1-5: Immediate Survival

**Your Starting Position**:
- Small shelter (5-10 tiles controlled)
- 20 population
- Basic stockpile of resources
- 2-3 Militia units

**Immediate Goals**:
1. **Secure Clean Water** (Most Critical)
   - Scout for water source within 5 tiles
   - Capture well, water tower, or treatment facility
   - Without water, your people die in ~10 turns

2. **Find Food**
   - Scavenge nearby supermarkets
   - Look for greenhouse or farm
   - Set up scavenging teams in residential ruins

3. **Establish Security Perimeter**
   - Position militia units around your shelter
   - Scout for threats (raiders, feral creatures, other factions)
   - Don't expand too fast - you can't defend everything

**Tutorial Tips**:
- Red outline = Critical shortage
- Yellow outline = Warning
- Green outline = Surplus
- Mouseover any resource for detailed breakdown

**First Decisions**:
- Which direction to expand (towards water? food? danger?)
- Where to assign your scavengers
- Whether to build more militia (defense) or workers (economy)

### Turn 6-15: Establishing Territory

**Goals**:
1. **Control 3 Basic Resource Locations**:
   - 1 Water source
   - 1 Food source
   - 1 Scrap source (scrapyard or ruins)

2. **Grow Population**:
   - With food and water secured, population grows 2-4% per turn
   - Assign new pops to scavenging or production

3. **First Contact**:
   - You'll encounter another faction
   - **Tutorial Choice**: How do you respond?
     - [Friendly]: Open trade negotiations
     - [Cautious]: Non-aggression pact only
     - [Hostile]: Demand they leave (risk war)
   - This choice affects diplomatic relationship

4. **Build Your First Building**:
   - Workshop (+5 production/turn)
   - Simple Fortification (+5 defense)
   - Water Tower (+water storage)

**New Mechanics Introduced**:
- **Production Queue**: Queue up buildings/units
- **Diplomacy**: Trade, pacts, alliances
- **Fog of War**: Can only see where your units can see
- **Tile Control**: Expanding your borders

**Tutorial Event**:
*"Radiation Storm Incoming"*
- Severe radiation storm will hit in 3 turns
- Must shelter population or suffer casualties
- Options:
  - Build radiation shelter (costs 100 scrap, 2 turns)
  - Send people underground (need tunnel access)
  - Accept casualties (-20% population)

This teaches: **Events have consequences, preparation matters**

### Turn 16-30: Cultural Awakening

**Goals**:
1. **Make Your First Cultural Choice**:
   - Accumulated 50 culture points
   - Tutorial explains culture system
   - **Choose One Governance Path to Start**:
     - Autocratic: "Strong leadership in hard times" (+military)
     - Democratic: "Unity through voices" (+happiness, diplomacy)
     - Collectivist: "Together we survive" (+production)
     - Tribal: "Blood bonds are strongest" (+loyalty)

   - Tutorial has you pick a Tier 3 location to target:
     - Hospital (medical)

     - Library (research)
     - Greenhouse (food)
   - This location is 10-15 tiles away
   - Plan route and expansion toward it

3. **First Military Campaign** (Optional):
   - Small raider band threatens your territory
   - 5 Raider units vs. your 2-3 Militia
   - **Choice**:
     - Fight them (tactical combat tutorial)
     - Pay tribute (lose 50 scrap, they leave)
     - Hire them (costly but gain raider units)

**Tactical Combat Tutorial** (If you fight):
- Enters tactical battle screen
- Teaches: Movement, cover, attacking, elevation
- Win condition: Eliminate all raiders
- Consequence: Gain loot, experience, secure area

**New Mechanics**:
- **Culture System**: Points, trees, choices
- **Tactical Combat**: Turn-based battles
- **Strategic Planning**: Long-term goals

### Turn 31-50: Expanding Empire

   - Success grants major advantage

2. **Establish Trade Route**:

   - Options:
     - Spend medicine (if you have it)

     - Do nothing (catastrophic casualties)
   - Teaches: **Resource stockpiles save lives**

**New Mechanics**:
- **Trade Routes**: Setup, benefits, risks

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Overexpansion
**Mistake**: Claiming too much territory too fast
**Result**: Can't defend it all, lose everything
**Solution**: Expand methodically, fortify what you take

### 2. Ignoring Water
**Mistake**: Prioritizing other resources over water
**Result**: Population dies rapidly
**Solution**: Water is #1 priority always

### 3. No Military
**Mistake**: "I'll just be peaceful and trade"
**Result**: Raiders attack, you're defenseless
**Solution**: Always maintain defensive force

### 4. Random Cultural Choices
**Mistake**: Picking culture nodes without plan
**Result**: No synergies, weak bonuses
**Solution**: Plan culture path toward victory condition

### 5. Fighting Everyone
**Mistake**: War on all fronts simultaneously
**Result**: Exhaustion, defeat
**Solution**: Make allies, fight one enemy at a time

### 6. Ignoring Events
**Mistake**: Dismissing events without reading
**Result**: Miss opportunities, suffer preventable disasters
**Solution**: Events matter - read and respond thoughtfully

### 7. No Reserves
